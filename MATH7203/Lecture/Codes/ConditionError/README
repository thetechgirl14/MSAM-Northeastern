This program accepts a condition number as input.  It then generates a
random matrix, A, of that condition number.  It also generates a
random vector b.  It then solves Ax=b, computes the residual, and
reports the norm of the residual as a measure of the solver's error.
It shows that as the condition number increases, the error increases. 

Run as follows:

test_condition_error(3)

test_condition_error(300)

test_condition_error(30000)
