This is a classroom demo.  It demonstrates both the benefit
of pivoting as well as the O(n^3) complexity of Gaussian elimination. 

To test pivoting:
pivot_demo.  It compares my naive gauss impl (no pivoting) against
Matlab's backslash linear solve operator (with pivoting).  It runs
both methods on a badly conditioned matrix.

To run timing:
Turn on Gauss elimination for n=1000 and even n=2000 to get a more
accurate fit for the time complexity.  Note that the program takes
much longer to run for these matrix sizes -- the complexity is
n^3 after all....
