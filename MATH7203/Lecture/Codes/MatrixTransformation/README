This function creates a random square matrix B with random condition
number k0.  It then creates the symmetric matrix A = B+B'.

It then plots the surface of the quadratic form u'*A*u using Matlab's
surf function.

Next, the fcn makes a plot of the levelsets of u'*A"u using Matlab's
contour function.

The thing to execute is the function run_plots.
